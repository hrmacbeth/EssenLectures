/-- In a Gromov-hyperbolic setting, convexity is not a well-defined notion as everything should
be coarse. The good replacement is quasi-convexity: A set `x` is `C`-quasi-convex if any pair of
points in `x` can be joined by a geodesic that remains within distance `C` of `x`. One could also
require this for all geodesics, up to changing `C`, as two geodesics between the same endpoints
remain within uniformly bounded distance. We use the first definition to ensure that a geodesic is
0-quasi-convex. -/

/-- If one projects a continuous curve on a quasi-convex set, the image does not have to be
connected (the projection is discontinuous), but since the projections of nearby points are within
uniformly bounded distance one can find in the projection a point with almost prescribed distance
to the starting point, say. For further applications, we also pick the first such point, i.e.,
all the previous points are also close to the starting point. -/

/- The idea is to define the desired point as the last point `u` for which there is a projection
at distance at most `d` of the starting point. Then the projection can not be much closer to
the starting point, or one could point another such point further away by almost continuity, giving
a contradiction. The technical implementation requires some care, as the "last point" may not
satisfy the property, for lack of continuity. If it does, then fine. Otherwise, one should go just
a little bit to its left to find the desired point. -/

The only nontrivial point to check is that the distance of `f u` to the starting point is not
too small. For this, we need to separate the case where `u = b` (in which case one argues directly)
and the case where `u < b`, where one can use a point slightly to the right of `u` which has a
projection at distance > `d` of the starting point, and use almost continuity. -/
